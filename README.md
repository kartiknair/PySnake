# PySnake

[![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/kartiknair/PySnake)

A tiny implementation on the snake game created using the [opc.py](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy/blob/master/examples/python/opc.py) library to display on a fadecandy LED display. This project was created by @firasahmed & me as a first year university project. The code is extensively documented (using comments) & follows PEP 8 naming conventions for highly readable & understandable code.
